    ">pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with ‚Äúrelational‚Äù or ‚Äúlabeled‚Äù data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, **real-world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis/manipulation tool available in any language.** It is already well on its way toward this goal.\n",

    "* Python is a highly object oriented language -- everything is essentially and object even *numbers* and *functions* (compare this to traditional computational languages such as C/Fortran). *This has both advantages and disadvantages.*\n",
    "* Python is multiparadigm and supports functional programming paradigms.\n",
    "* Python is dynamically or duck-typed; *this again has both advantages and disadvantages*\n",
    "* A pattern we will often use in data science, especially with python, is one where we have a data object/class and we use stateless functions to transform this data either creating a new data object/class. Core data objects/classes for this are pandas `DataFrame` and `Series` though they are not the only such data structures we would want to use in the python ecosystem."
